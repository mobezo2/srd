% specnoise.m plot the spectrum of a noise signal

% The randn function returns a sample of random numbers from a normal distribution with mean 0 and variance 1. 
% The general theory of random variables states that if x is a random variable whose mean is μx and variance is σ2x, 
% then the random variable, y, defined by y=ax+b,where a and b are constants, has mean μy=aμx+b and variance σ2y=a2σ2x. 
% You can apply this concept to get a sample of normally distributed random numbers with mean 500 and variance 25.
